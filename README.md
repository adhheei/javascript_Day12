# 🚀 Day 11: Promises & Promise Methods

### 📚 Learn
- Understand **why we need Promises** in JavaScript and **when to use them**.  
- Learn how Promises help handle **asynchronous operations** like API calls and file reading.  
- Study the **Promise lifecycle** (`pending → fulfilled → rejected`) and how to chain `.then()` and `.catch()` effectively.  
- This is a crucial topic — you’ll be using Promises frequently in future projects (especially with APIs, Node.js, and async code).

---

### 💻 Code Task
**Goal:**  
Create any dummy APIs using `fetch()` and handle responses with Promises.  

**Example Ideas:**  
- Fetch random user data from an API and log it in the console.  
- Simulate an API call using `setTimeout` wrapped in a Promise.  
- Handle API success and failure using `.then()` and `.catch()` blocks.

---

### 🔁 Revise
Focus on understanding and practicing the following **Promise methods**:
- `Promise.all()` – Wait for all promises to resolve.  
- `Promise.any()` – Returns the first successfully resolved promise.  
- `Promise.allSettled()` – Returns results of all promises (fulfilled or rejected).  
- `Promise.race()` – Returns the first promise that settles (resolved or rejected).

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Promises help make asynchronous code more readable and manageable.  
- Useful for handling **API requests**, **file operations**, and **delayed actions**.  
- Practice using multiple Promise methods to handle complex async logic.
